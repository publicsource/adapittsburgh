If you thought kids were responsible for text abbreviations like “LOL” and “IDK,” think again. Texting was created for people who are deaf or hard of hearing. 

From texting to somewhat comic devices like Segways, new norms and technologies that many of us now enjoy grew from the needs of people with disabilities. The 30-year-old Americans with Disabilities Act played a part.

“It wasn’t until 1990 that people realized that people with disabilities have the right to vote, live in their own homes, fly on an airplane,” says Dr. Rory Cooper, who directs the Human Engineering Research Laboratories (HERL) at the University of Pittsburgh. His team develops new robotic limbs, wheelchairs and other mobility devices. 

Equity advocate Angela Glover Blackwell says as much in an article in the Stanford Social Innovation Review. <a href="https://ssir.org/articles/entry/the_curb_cut_effect">article</a>

“When the wall of exclusion came down, everybody benefited,” she wrote, citing the example of the corners of sidewalk curbs cut into slopes.

“Parents pushing strollers headed straight for curb cuts, Blackwell writes. “So did workers pushing heavy carts, business travelers wheeling luggage, even runners and skateboarders.” 

Blackwell points out that nine out of 10 “unencumbered pedestrians” go out of their way to use a curb cut, according to one study. Today, curb cuts are so commonplace, we tend to forget their original intent. In fact, this very concept, a design meant to benefit wheelchair users ultimately benefits all of society, is called the “curb cut effect.”

Curb cuts were first installed in Kalamazoo, Michigan when disabled veteran and lawyer Jack Fisher successfully advocated for them. World War II veterans were returning with disabilities and demand grew for accessibility. The need drove what’s called assistive or universal design.

In the early ‘90s, Dr. Rory Cooper tested out a wheelchair that could climb stairs, curbs, and traverse snow. It was called the iBot. 

“I was the first person with a disability to sit on it,” said Cooper. He’d used a wheelchair since 1980 after being hit by a bus,

The iBot was expensive for its time. It wasn’t granted Medicare approval that might have made it marketable to people with disabilities. But the technology was recycled to create the upright Segway people mover. No longer useful to wheelchair users, it’s a boon for sightseers whirring along city sidewalks or mall cops. 

“Anytime I see one of those,” Dr. Cooper said, “I can smile and remember a time where it didn’t exist.”

In 1990, designer Formosa led development of the thick, rubber-handled can openers and other tools called OXO “Good Grips.” Originally invented for people with arthritis or low vision, the tools are easier on everyone’s hands. 

Formosa has millions of views on Youtube for his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25peayoZOfs">videos with Epicurious</a> about improving the design of kitchen products.

“If more people can use a product, it’s in everyone’s interest,” he said. “Design can include or exclude people. If you are alienating people who have physical challenges, it’s a form of segregation. Disability is determined by design.”

<b>Disability Advisor Note:</b>
Having a disability is expensive. Just like curb cuts and OXO products, "disability accommodations" can be beneficial to everyone. As an individual who has had a disability since birth, I spend or my insurance pays a monthly rental fee of $2000 for a ventilator, over $30,000, power wheelchair, and on average $30 an hour for my in-home care. My care and medications annually cost--as a healthy person with a disability--at least $250,000. When an item or modification is considered “special” or to serve a niche population, the price is significantly higher. This is why universal design is critical. As the general public sees the benefit of using assistive technology the demand goes up, decreasing the cost of these accommodations. Integrating universal design helps everyone, making life easier for the general population and more independent for the disability community.
