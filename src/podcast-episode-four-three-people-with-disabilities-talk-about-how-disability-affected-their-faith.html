          <p>Religious traditions can offer mixed messages about disability. Just like for all believers, images and words from spiritual communities can provide encouragement, purpose and belonging. But sometimes disability adds baggage — blame, confusion and exclusion.</p>

          <p>In this podcast, two men share their understanding of their physical disabilities and higher powers. And a woman talks about how bipolar disorder led to her being a confirmed atheist. They share their stories in this episode of ADA at 30: Accessibility in Pittsburgh. This is a companion podcast to adapittsburgh.com, a collaboration between PublicSource and Unabridged Press.</p>
