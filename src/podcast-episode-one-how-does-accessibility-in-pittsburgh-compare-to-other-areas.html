          <p>A shop owner wanted Damitra Penny and her wheelchair out of the store. At least Penny was in Pittsburgh, not Switzerland. Many disability advocates list Europe as one of the worst places to get around. The Pittsburgh area this podcast explores has aging infrastructure, hills aplenty and three rivers slicing up the Downtown from its shoreline ballparks and its bar district. The personal trials and public responses where the wheelchair hits the road are featured in this show.</p>

          <p>Hosts and Guests: Analysts Josie Badger, healthcare ethicist, and Alisa Grishman, disability advocate. Additional stories about the world from a wheelchair from Jon Duvall and Damitra Penny. Reporters Tony Ganzer and Jennifer Szweda Jordan, Unabridged Press. Pittsburgh and Allegheny County disability coordinators Hillary Roman and Caylin Snyder.</p>
