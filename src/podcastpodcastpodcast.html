            <p>A shop owner wanted Damitra Penny and her wheelchair out of the store. At least Penny was in Pittsburgh, not Switzerland. Many disability advocates list Europe as one of the worst places to get around. The Pittsburgh area this podcast explores has aging infrastructure, hills aplenty and three rivers slicing up the Downtown from its shoreline ballparks and its bar district. The personal trials and public responses where the wheelchair hits the road are featured in this show.</p>

            <p>Hosts and Guests: Analysts Josie Badger, healthcare ethicist, and Alisa Grishman, disability advocate. Additional stories about the world from a wheelchair from Jon Duvall and Damitra Penny. Reporters Tony Ganzer and Jennifer Szweda Jordan, Unabridged Press. Pittsburgh and Allegheny County disability coordinators Hillary Roman and Caylin Snyder.</p>

            <p>From anti-discrimination provisions to access, the Americans with Disabilities Act represented a civil rights milestone at its enactment in 1990. We've now had 30 years to see how the act has empowered our communities and made them more inclusive. But we've also had 30 years to see where the act may have fallen short.</p>

            <p>In this episode of ADA at 30: Accessibility in Pittsburgh, we’re joined by a lawyer who was 10 years into his legal career when the ADA was passed. It ushered in cases he pressed in labor and employment discrimination. Jay Hornack is now a Legal Committee member of Disability Rights Pennsylvania, a hearing officer for the Pennsylvania Office of Vocational Rehabilitation, and adjunct professor of disability discrimination law at the University of Pittsburgh's School of Law.</p>

            <p>Hosts and Guests: Analysts Josie Badger, healthcare ethicist, and Alisa Grishman, disability advocate. Reporter/producers Tony Ganzer and Jennifer Szweda Jordan, Unabridged Press. Jay Hornack, disability rights lawyer.</p>
