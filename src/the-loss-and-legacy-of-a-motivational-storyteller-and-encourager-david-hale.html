It was on the guest list for an event I helped organize, a Dis/Ability Symposium in 2019. A person who’d pick that name had to be a good soul, I thought. The address belonged to David Hale, who was, indeed, a good soul. I learned recently that David died. His is a story we could all learn from now.">
